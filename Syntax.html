    <h1> LX Syntax </h1>

    <h3> Variable declaration </h3>

    LX is a staticly typed language. Similar to C++ you can declare a variable without defining it.

    <p>
    int var1 = 0;
    int var2; # Undefined
    </p>

    <h3> Types </h3>

    <h5> Basic types: </h5>
    - int (whole number)
    - float (decimal value)
    - char (single ASCII character)
    - bool (true or false)
    - void (empty)
    - string (a list of characters)

    To mark a variable as a constant use the const keyword. Const variables must have a definition with thier declaration.

    <p>
    # Constant integer
    const int var = 3;
    </p>

    When defining a variable using a type you can modify attributes of the type using the operator[]. Int and float types have extra two attributes (signed, size).

    <p>
    # Simple declaration
    int var;

    # Unsigned int declaration
    int[U] var;

    # Small int declaration
    int[S] var;

    # There are 3 size:
    # S(Small), N(Normal), L(Large)

    # Creates a unsigned small int
    int[ S, U ] var;
    </p>

    Char has no sizes and only can be signed and unsigned

    <h5> Memory types </h5>

    To create a pointer (or reference of a variable) you must use thier relevant keyword:

    <p>
    # Int reference declaration
    ref int = var;

    # Int pointer declaration
    ptr int = var;
    </p>

    Pointers have an ownership flag which has three states:
    - R (raw) - pointer has no ownership of it's contents (default)
    - S (shared) - pointer shares it's contents and when they are all out of scope the contents are deleted
    - U (unique) - pointer own's it's contents and when it goes out of scope it is deleted

    <h3> Comments </h3>

    Comments in LX are marked with a #. The comment ends at the end of the line or at the next hashtag.

    <p>
    # This is a comment # while (true)
    </p>

    <h3> Simple Control Flow </h3>

    If statement conditions are not required to be in brackets but must be followed by a colon. The following code must be in Braces. If no braces are found it will assume the next line of code is the contents.

    <p>
    if true:
        console::print("Condition is true");

    console::print("This will not be in the if statement");
    </p>

    LX also supports elif and else

    <p>
    if false:
        console::print("This wont run");

    elif true:
        console::print("But this will");

    else:
        console::print("This also won't run");
    </p>

    <h3> While loops </h3>

    Similar to if-else statements while loops do not require brackets around the statement. The contents of the 

    <p>
    while True:
    {
        console::print("Who else loves infinite loops");
    }
    </p>

    You can also chain else off a while statement. The else statement will only run if the loop is never run.

    <p>
    while False:
    {
        console::print("Loop never runs");
    }

    else
    {
        console::print("But this does");
    }
    </p>

    <h3> For loops </h3>

    LX takes inspiration from python for its for loops.

    <p>
    # Iterates upto 5
    for i in [5]:
    {
        console::print(i, "\t");
    }

    # Output:
    # 0    1   2   3   4

    </p>

    You can modify what it starts iterating from and what it iterates by like this:
    <p>
    # Starts on 2
    # Ends on 5
    # Iterates 0.5 every loop
    for i in [2, 5, 0.5]:
    </p>

    <h5> Range based for loops </h5>

    You can iterate over items in a array/list/vector. The iterator(item in the example) will be a reference to the variable in the large data type. This means any modifications to it will also change the variable in the large data type.

    <p>
    for item in largeDataType:
    {
        console::print(item);
    }
    </p>

    <h3> Logical operators </h3>

    Logical operators can either be written as thier operator or word form. For example this:
    <p>
    || && !
    </p>
    Is the same as:
    <p>
    or and not
    </p>

    <h3> Function definition/declaration </h3>

    LX has two types of functions: procedure and standard

    Standard functions are defined as such:

    <p>
    func&lt;int&gt; main()
    {
        return 0;
    }
    </p>

    Procedure function calls are replaced with the function code (similar to inline functions in C++). For highest performace they are best used for frequently called simple functions. Such as setters and getters.

    <p>
    proc&lt;int&gt; getVar()
    {
        return var;
    }
    </p>

    Similiar to if statements if no braces are found it will assume the next line of code is the contents

    <p>
    proc&lt;int&gt; getVar()
        return var;
    </p>

    If no type is chosen the preprocessor will asume void.

    Unlike in C++ you must provide a definition with the declaration. The preprocessor will make sure that there are no errors.
