# C++ Preprocessor

This project is creating a preprocsessor for C++. This means lx code will be translated into c++ then compiled.

The languages website can be found [here](https://pashabibko.github.io/CPP-Preproceser/)
The website includes a replica of this readME as well as other stuff

## Features of LX

##### 1. Type Switching

Type Switches are a way to run a certain scope of code for the true type of a pointer.
This is useful for when you have a base class pointer and you want to run a certain function for each derived class.

##### 2. Easy enum conversion to and from string

Enums can be converted to strings and vice versa with ease.
This is useful for when you want to convert an enum to a string for debug printing
or storing in a file for a more readable format.

##### 3. Extensive macro functionality

Macros in LX are more powerful than in C++.
They automatically have information about the ammount of arguments they have.
Other features can be found here: WIP

##### 4. Function decerators

Function decorators are a way to add functionality to a function without modifying the function itself.
This is useful for when you want to add logging, timing, or other functionality to a function without modifying the function itself.
