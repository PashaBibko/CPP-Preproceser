            <h1> LX Syntax </h1>

            <h2> Comments </h2>

            <p>
                Comments in LX are marked with a '#' symbol.
                The comment either ends at the end of that line or when the next '#' symbol is found.
            </p>

                <div class = "code">
                    <p> # This is a comment <br> # This is a comment # This is not a comment </p>
                </div>
            
            <p>
                Comments are currently ignored by the preprocessor.
                In the future they will be be inserted into the generated C++ code as comments.
            </p>

            <br>

            <h2> Variable declaration </h2>

            <p>
                Variables in lx types are hard coded.
                This means that the type of the variable cannot be changed at runtime.
                This is because C++ is a statically typed language.
                <br>
                Also similiar to C++ you can define a variable without a value.
                This is useful for when you want to define a variable but you don't have a value for it yet.
                Note that the variable will be undefined until you assign a value to it.
            </p>

            <div class = "code">
                <p> int var1 = 0; <br> int var2; # Undefined </p>
            </div>

            <br>

            <h2> Types </h2>

            <h3> Int and Float </h3>

            <p>
                Int and Float are both reprsentations of numbers.
                Int is a whole number and float is a decimal number.
            </p>

            <div class = "code">
                <p> int var1 = 0; <br> float var2 = 0.0; </p>
                <p> # var3 will have a contents of 3 due to truncation <br> int var3 = 3.1459 </p>
            </div>

            <p>
                Ints are defined by the 'int' keyword and floats are defined by the 'float' keyword.
                You can also make it unsigned by adding the 'unsigned' keyword before the type.
                This means that the number cannot be negative.
            </p>

            <h3> Bool </h3>

            <p>
                Bool is a representation of a true or false value.
                It is defined by the 'bool' keyword.
            </p>

            <p>
                The values are 'true' and 'false'.
                The first letter can be capitalized or lowercase.
                You can also use '1' and '0' to represent true and false.
            </p>

            <div class = "code">
                <p> # All variables store true <br> bool var1 = True; <br> bool var2 = true; <br> bool var3 = 1; </p>
            </div>

            <h3> Char and String </h3>

            <p>
                Char is a single ASCII character.
                If you do not know what ASCII is find out 
                
                <a href = "https://www.ascii-code.com" target = "_blank">
                    here.
                </a>

                <br>
            
                It is defined by the 'char' keyword.
            </p>

            <p>
                String is a collection of characters.
                It is defined by the 'string' keyword.
                You can access the individual characters of a string by using the [] operator.
            </p>

            <div class = "code">
                <p> # Stores the letter 'a' <br> char var1 = 'a'; </p>
                <p> string var2 = "Hello"; <br> char var3 = var2[0]; </p>
            </div>

            <h3> Void </h3>

            <p>
                Void is a type that represents nothing.
                It is defined by the 'void' keyword.
                It is used for functions that do not return a value.
            </p>

            <p>
                You can also use void as a type for a variable.
                This means that the variable does not have a type.
                This is useful for when you want to store a pointer to any type (however it is recommended to use a base class pointer).
            </p>

            <br>

            <h2> If and Else Statements </h2>

            <p>
                If statements are used to run a certain scope of code if a condition is true.
                Else statements are used to run a certain scope of code if the condition is false.
                Elif statements are used to run a certain scope of code if the previous condition is false and the current condition is true.
            </p>

            <p>
                The keywords use the corresponding 'if', 'else', and 'elif' keywords.
                Their conditions are not required to be in parentheses but must be followed by a colon.
                The scope of the code is defined by curly brackets unless the scope is only one line.
            </p>

            <div class = "code">
                <p>
                    # One line If statement example <br>
                    if var1 == 0: <br>
                    &emsp; var1 = 1; <br>
                    <br>

                    # You can still use brackets if you prefer <br>
                    elif (var1 == 1): <br>
                    { <br>
                    &emsp; var1 = 2; <br>
                    } <br>
                    <br>

                    # Else statements cannot have any conditions <br>
                    # That is the purpose of the elif statement <br>
                    else: <br>
                    { <br>
                    &emsp; var1 = 0; <br>
                    } <br>
                </p>
            </div>

            <h2> While Loops </h2>

            <p>
                While loops are used to run a certain scope of code while a condition is true.
                It follows the same syntax as the if statement.
            </p>

            <div class = "code">
                <p>
                    while True: <br>
                    { <br>
                        &emsp; console::print("Who loves infinite loops?"); <br>
                    } <br>
                </p>
            </div>

            <h2> For Loops </h2>

            <p>
                For loops are used to run a certain scope of code a certain number of times.
                It follows the same syntax as the while loop for the contents of the loop.
            </p>

            <p>
                By default the for loop starts at 0 and goes up to the number before the number you specify (iterating by 1 each time).
            </p>

            <div class = "code">
                <p>
                    for int i count [5]: <br>
                    { <br>
                        &emsp; console::print(i, ", "); <br>
                    } <br>

                    <br>
                    # This will print 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, <br>
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>
                You can also specify the starting number and the increment.
            </p>
            
            <div class = "code">
                <p>
                    # Starts on 1 <br>
                    # Goes up to 5 <br>
                    # Iterates by 2 <br>
                    <br>
                    for int i count [1, 5, 2]: <br>
                    { <br>
                        &emsp; console::print(i, ", "); <br>
                    } <br>
                </p>
            </div>

            <h3> Range based for loops </h3>

            <p>
                Instead of iterating through a range the size of the container you can iterate through the container itself.
                For each iteration you will be given a reference to the current element.
                This means any changes you make to the element will be reflected in the container.
            </p>

            <div class = "code">
                <p>
                    int[] arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]; <br>
                    <br>
                    for int i in arr: <br>
                    { <br>
                        &emsp; console::print(i, ", "); <br>
                    } <br>
                </p>
            </div>

            <h2> Binary Logical Operators </h2>

            <p>
                Binary logical operators are used to compare two values.
                They return a boolean value.
            </p>

            <p>
                There are two sets of binary logical operators.
                The first set is the comparison operators (!=, ==, <, >, <=, >=).
                The second set is the logical operators (and, or, not) which can also be written as (&&, ||, !).
            </p>

            <p>
                Comparison operators are used to compare two values of the same type.
                == and != are the only operators that can be used on all types.
                The rest can only be used on arethmetic types.
            </p>

            <p>
                Logical operators are used to compare two boolean values.
                'and' returns true if both values are true.
                'or' returns true if at least one value is true.
                'not' returns true if the value is false.
            </p>
