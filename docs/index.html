            <h1> LX C++ Preprocesor </h1>

            <p>
                This project is creating a preprocsessor for C++. This means lx code will be translated into c++ then compiled.
                This means it is easy to integrate into existing projects and can be used in any c++ project.
            </p>

            <h2> Custom Features of LX </h2>

            <h3> Type Switches </h3>

            <p>
                Type Switches are a way to run a certain scope of code for the true type of a pointer.
                This is useful for when you have a base class pointer and you want to run a certain function for each derived class.

            </p>

            <h3> Easy Enum Conversion With Strings </h3>

            <p>
                Enums can be converted to strings and vice versa with ease.
                This is useful for when you want to convert an enum to a string for debug printing
                or storing in a file for a more readable format.

            <h3> Extensive Macro Functionality </h3>

            <p>
                Macros in LX are more powerful than in C++.
                They automatically have information about the ammount of arguments they have.
                Other features can be found here: WIP
            </p>

            <h3> Function Decorators </h3>

            <p>
                Function decorators are a way to add functionality to a function without modifying the function itself.
                This is useful for when you want to add logging, timing, or other functionality to a function without modifying the function itself.
